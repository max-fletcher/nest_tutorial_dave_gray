In order to setup prisma, do the following-

1. Create a database and re-open it in pgadmin4 so a password is setup for the database
2. Install prisma using "npm i prisma -D" and then "npm prisma init"
3. Copy the necessary credentials to the connection string in the .env(modify the "prisma/schema.prisma" file's datasource
 if needed i.e with neon)
4. Define all the models in "prisma/schema.prisma"
5. Use- 
    npx prisma migrate dev (for dev environment. Will save the sql statements so you can use/view them later)
      OR
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init (for dev environment. Will save the sql statements so you can use/view them later under a named migration)
      OR
    npx prisma migrate push (for dev environment. Will not save the sql statements)
      OR
    npx prisma migrate deploy (to push your change to the online database that is in server)
6. In order to change the migration.sql, use "npx prisma generate" to re-generate changes to the schema, but in order to apply those changes
  to the database, you need to use "npx prisma migrate dev --name {name_of_change}" to have the changes applied to the DB tables
  Hence, if you wanna change the database, edit the "schema.prisma" file, then run "npx prisma generate" and finally,
  run "npx prisma migrate dev --name {name_of_change}" to get the necessary changes in DB.
